---+!! Media Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%.

Uses the =OBJECT= html tag to embed arbitrary content into a page, with a particular bent towards media: common media formats are detected and some "agnostic best-guess" html is used (derived from that recommended by
the plugin providers).
However, any content can be embedded using the object tag: java, pdf, other html, svg, even images (although for the latter is of course no real reason to do so this way).
The plugin uses generic syntax when it cannot detect the type of file being embedded.

The plugin stores a range of default values (defined here on this page)
which allow you to specify a bare minimum of info in your markup and still
get acceptable results (see [[#Basic_Usage][Basic Usage]] below).
These defaults can of course be overridden on a use-by-use basis.

%TOC%

---++ Basic Usage

You *could* call the plugin as simply as:

<verbatim>
%MEDIA{"SomeMovie.mov"}%
</verbatim>

This will detect that the embedded file is a !QuickTime and use "media-like" syntax (and pass the correct =classid= to IE - why it can't work out which plugin to use is a little beyond me). However, unlike an =IMG= tag, plugins do not autosize to their content, and the movie would display at the default size. You could use media of only one size site-wide and specify the dimensions as defaults, but realistically the minimum markup you need to embed things into your wiki pages is:

=%<nop>MEDIA{"SomeMovie.swf" width="320" height="180"}%=

---++ Advanced Usage

A call to the !MediaPlugin could get as complicated as:

<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
src="SomeMovie.wmv"
width="320"
height="180"
controller="FALSE"
play="TRUE"
myparam1="3.1419"
myparam2="edinburgh"
}%
</verbatim>

See for possible attributes below.

Note that !MediaPlugin figures out the correct mime type parameter so that the correct plugin will be called to deal with that content.

---++ Syntax

!MediaPlugin supports arbitrary parameters. If you pass it =cowtype="Jersey"=, it will passed on to the browser.

A few parameters are defined and get handled a little differently (they may be "translated" to a particular browser plugins syntax).

| *Parameter*  | *Value* | *Description* | *Notes* |
| =""=, =src=, =data=        | URI or file name | The content to embed. Relative URIs are interpreted with respect to the =codebase= attribute if it is given. | |
| =width=      | Standard web measure (px, %, em) | Width of box holding content | |
| =height=     | Standard web measure (px, %, em) | Height of box holding content| |
| =controller= | text boolean ("TRUE" or "FALSE")| Whether to display controls|automatically added |
| =play=       | text boolean | whether to auto-play the content| Automatically added for !QuickTime and Flash |

---+++ Syntax for !QuickTime mov

See [[http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/embed2.html][Overview of Embed Tag Attributes]] for !QuickTime.

---+++ Syntax for Flash swf

Pass Flash movie attributes within the =%<nop>MEDIA{...}%= accolades (all values within quotes). When a particular parameter is not specified, the default value will be used (see table below).

prefix="<h4>"
mode="div"
showlink="&#9658; Attributes for Flash"
hidelink="&#9660; Attributes for Flash"
suffix="</h4>"

%TABLE{sort="off" headeralign="left"}%
| *Parameter*   | *Description*   | *Example*   |
| <strong>Required attributes</strong>  ||||
| =src=     | Filepath of the movie; should have suffix =.swf= ("src=" can be omitted) | =mypath/flashmovie.swf= |

| <strong>Advanced attributes</strong>  |||
| =align= | Default centers the movie in the browser window and crops edges if the browser window is smaller than the movie. =l= (left), =r= (right), =t= (top), and =b= (bottom) align the movie along the corresponding edge of the browser window and crop the remaining three sides as needed. | ="l"=, ="r"=, ="t"=, ="b"= |

| =wmode= | Sets the Window Mode property of the Flash movie for transparency, layering, and positioning in the browser. %BR% \
=window= - movie plays in its own rectangular window on a web page. %BR% \
=opaque= - the movie hides everything on the page behind it. %BR% \
=transparent= - the background of the HTML page shows through all transparent portions of the movie, this may slow animation performance. | ="window"=, ="opaque"= or ="transparent"= |
| =play= | Specifies whether the movie begins playing immediately on loading in the browser. | ="true"= or ="false"= | 
| =loop= | Specifies whether the movie repeats indefinitely or stops when it reaches the last frame. | ="true"= or ="false"= |

Sorry - I could not find any page for this.

---++ Examples

---+++ wmv
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{

---++ Notes for developers
---+++ Detection of media type / recommended plugin syntax

The plugin detects most media types and uses a hybrid of the html markup
recommended by the browser plugin makers - in the hope of providing maximum compatibility.
This is done simply by checking the extension of the filename. Or, if the filename contains =youtube.com= it will automatically use Flash.

Originally, the plugin used (almost) the exact recommended HTML on a type-by-type basis, but I've abandoned this in favor of "one markup fits all" because you don't know which plugin will be handling what - the various ISO formats (MPEG1,2,4, MP3) will be taken by whatever plugin was installed last, and !QuickTime now handles Windows Media on Macintosh systems (at Microsoft's recommendation!).

While most of the HTML is as generic as possible, the =classid= value and some
other mime-type information is unique to a particular file-type, and for Flash,
!QuickTime and Windows Media the Microsoft-sanctioned values are sent.
I understand MSIE has to have this info or it totally burns ...

I haven't bothered with Real. If there's huge demand, it wouldn't be hard to add - but it may also be handled quite well by the generic media syntax already.


---+++ Defining additional file formats
The output of this plugin is partially governed by Foswiki templates. The =mov= file output is defined in =templates/objectplugin_mov.tmpl=:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{"object"}%<object{MP_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES}>{MP_OBJECT_PARAMS}<embed{MP_EMBED_ATTRIBUTES}/></object>%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>
Placeholders ={MP_...}= are replaced by =%<nop>MEDIA{...}%= parameters. 

To add other types add your own template using the same naming scheme (=objectplugin_ext.tmpl=).


---++ Plugin Settings

You can override the default settings for the plugin by defining the following preferences in %MAINWEB%.SitePreferences.%BR%
Use the notation =NAMEOFPLUGIN_NAMEOFSETTING=, for example: =MEDIAPLUGIN_DEBUG=
<!--
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Embed multimedia objects such as Flash or !QuickTime in topics
-->
%TABLE{databg="#ffffff"}%
| *Preference* | *Meaning* | *Default* |
| =WIDTH= | Default width of player  | =320= |
| =HEIGHT= | Default height of player  | =180= |
| =CONTROLLER= | Switch that defines if the controller is shown  | =TRUE= |
| =PLAY= | Switch that defines if the media is played automatically  | =TRUE= |
| =DEBUG=  | If set to =1=, writes debugging info to =data/debug.txt= | 0 |
