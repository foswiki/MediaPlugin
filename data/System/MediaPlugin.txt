---+!! Media Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Uses the =OBJECT= html tag to embed arbitrary content into a wiki page, with a particular bent towards media:
common media formats are detected and some "agnostic best-guess" html is used (derived from that recommended by
the plugin providers).
However, any content at all can be embedded using the object tag: java, pdf, other html, svg,
even images (although there is of course no reason to do so).
The plugin uses generic syntax when it cannot detect the type of file being embedded.

The plugin stores a range of default values (defined here on this page)
which allow you to specify a bare minimum of info in your markup and still
get acceptable results (see [[#Basic_Usage][Basic Usage]] below).
These defaults can of course be overridden on a use-by-use basis.

%TOC%

---++Basic Usage

You *could* call the plugin as simply as:

=%<nop>OBJECT{"SomeMovie.mov"}%=

This will detect that the embedded file is a !QuickTime and use "media-like" syntax (and pass the correct =CLASSID= to IE - why it can't work out which plugin to use is a little beyond me). However, unlike an =IMG= tag, plugins do not autosize to their content, and the movie would display at the default size. You could use media of only one size site-wide and specify the dimensions as defaults, but realistically the minimum markup you need to embed things into your wiki pages is:

=%<nop>OBJECT{"SomeMovie.swf" width="320" height="180"}%=

---++ Advanced Usage

A call to the !MediaPlugin could get as complicated as:

=%<nop>OBJECT{src="SomeMovie.wmv" width="320" height="180" controller="FALSE" play="TRUE" myparam1="3.1419" myparam2="edinburgh"}%=

Once you start passing a ton of parameters, you aren't gaining much by using the plugin, and you may actually be reducing the portability of your code, so it may be best to do your own HTML.

%H% Including a "mime-type" parameter may help your browser choose which browser plugin to use more efficiently

---++ Syntax

!MediaPlugin supports arbitrary parameters. If you pass it =cowtype="Jersey"=, that is passed on to the browser, both as a =<<nop>PARAM>= tag.

A few parameters are defined and get handled a little differently (they may be "translated" to a particular browser plugins syntax).

| *Parameter*  | *Value* | *Description* | *Notes* |
| =src=        | URI or file name | the content to embed | "src=" is optional |
| =width=      | Standard web measure (px, %, em) | width of box holding content | |
| =height=     | Standard web measure (px, %, em) | height of box holding content| |
| =controller= | text boolean ("TRUE" or "FALSE")| whether to display controls|automatically added |
| =play=       | text boolean | whether to auto-play the content| automatically added for !QuickTime and Flash |

---+++ Attributes for Flash swf

Pass Flash movie attributes within the =%<nop>MEDIA{...}%= accolades (all values within quotes). When a particular parameter is not specified, the default value will be used (see table below).

<!-- %TABLE{sort="off" headeralign="left"}% -->
| *Parameter*   | *Comment*   | *Example*   |
| <strong>Required attributes</strong>  ||||
| =src=     | Filepath of the movie; should have suffix =.swf= ("src=" can be omitted) | =mypath/flashmovie.swf= |
| <strong>General attributes</strong>  |||
| =width=  | Width of Flash movie in pixels, or a percentage. 100% means one hundred percent of the available width on the page. | ="50%"= or ="500px"= |
| =height=  | Height of Flash movie in pixels, or a percentage. 100% means one hundred percent of the available height on the page. | ="50%"= or ="500px"= |
| =bgcolor= | Background color of Flash movie in hex string. When omitted, no background color will be specified and the background color of the Flash movie will be used. | ="#cccccc"= |
| <strong>Advanced attributes</strong>  |||
| =align= | Default centers the movie in the browser window and crops edges if the browser window is smaller than the movie. =l= (left), =r= (right), =t= (top), and =b= (bottom) align the movie along the corresponding edge of the browser window and crop the remaining three sides as needed. | ="l"=, ="r"=, ="t"=, ="b"= |
| =salign= | =l=, =r=, =t=, and =b= align the movie along the left, right, top or bottom edge, respectively, of the browser window and crop the remaining three sides as needed. %BR% \
=tl= and =tr= align the movie to the top left and top right corner, respectively, of the browser window and crop the bottom and remaining right or left side as needed. %BR% \
=bl= and =br= align the movie to the bottom left and bottom right corner, respectively, of the browser window and crop the top and remaining right or left side as needed. | ="l"=, ="t"=, ="r"=, ="b"=, ="tl"=, ="tr"=, ="bl"=, ="br"= |
| =scale= | Scaling of Flash movie. | ="noborder"=, ="exactfit"=, ="noscale"=, ="showall"= |
| =quality= | Playback quality. | ="best"=, ="high"=, ="medium"=, ="low"=, ="autohigh"=, ="autolow"= |
| =menu= | Should right-click on Flash movie show a (default) menu? Note that with the Flash 7 player the menu cannot be removed. | ="true"= or ="false"= |
| =id=     | ID of Flash movie; for general use not necessary to specify. | ="movie2"= |
| =wmode= | Sets the Window Mode property of the Flash movie for transparency, layering, and positioning in the browser. %BR% \
=window= - movie plays in its own rectangular window on a web page. %BR% \
=opaque= - the movie hides everything on the page behind it. %BR% \
=transparent= - the background of the HTML page shows through all transparent portions of the movie, this may slow animation performance. | ="window"=, ="opaque"= or ="transparent"= |
| =play= | Specifies whether the movie begins playing immediately on loading in the browser. | ="true"= or ="false"= | 
| =loop= | Specifies whether the movie repeats indefinitely or stops when it reaches the last frame. | ="true"= or ="false"= |
| =allowscriptaccess= | Controls the ability to perform outbound scripting from within a Flash SWF. %BR% \
When allowScriptAccess is =never=, outbound scripting always fails. %BR% \
When allowScriptAccess is =always=, outbound scripting always succeeds. %BR% \
If allowScriptAccess is =sameDomain= (it is supported in SWFs from Flash Player 8), outbound scripting is allowed only if the SWF file resides in the same domain as the hosting web page. | ="sameDomain"=, ="always"= or ="never"= |
| =fullscreen= | Enabled scriptable fullscreen mode. An overlay dialog box will appear when the movie enters full-screen mode, instructing the user how to exit and return to normal mode. The dialog box appears for a few seconds and then fades out. | ="true"= or ="false"= |
| =base= | Specifies the base directory or URL used to resolve all relative path statements in the Flash Player movie. This attribute is helpful when your Flash Player movies are kept in a different directory from your other files. | any directory URL, or empty string =""= |
| =swliveconnect= | Specifies whether the browser should start Java when loading the Flash Player for the first time. | ="true"= or ="false"= |
| =flashvars= | Variables to be passed to the Flash movie. Multiple variables are separated by =&amp;=. | =flashvars="x=50&y=100&url=%<nop>ATTACHURL%/picture.jpg"= |

---++ Detection of media type/Recommended plugin syntax

The plugin detects most media types and uses a hybrid of the html markup
recommended by the browser plugin makers - in the hope of providing maximum compatibility.
This is done simply by checking the extension of the filename. Or, if the filename contains =youtube.com= it will automatically use Flash.

Originally, the plugin used (almost) the exact recommended HTML on a type-by-type basis, but I've abandoned this in favor of "one markup fits all" because you don't know which plugin will be handling what - the various ISO formats (MPEG1,2,4, MP3) will be taken by whatever plugin was installed last, and !QuickTime now handles Windows Media on Macintosh systems (at Microsoft's recommendation!).

While most of the HTML is as generic as possible, the =classid= value and some
other mime-type information is unique to a particular file-type, and for Flash,
!QuickTime and Windows Media the  Microsoft-sanctioned values are sent.
I understand MSIE has to have this info or it totally burns ...

I haven't bothered with Real.
If there's huge demand, it wouldn't be hard to add -
but it may also be handled quite well by the generic media syntax already.

---++ Defining additional file formats
The output of this plugin is partially governed by Foswiki templates. The =mov= file output is defined in =templates/objectplugin_mov.tmpl=:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{"object"}%<object{MP_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES}>{MP_OBJECT_PARAMS}<embed{MP_EMBED_ATTRIBUTES}/></object>%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>
Placeholders ={MP_...}= are replaced by =%<nop>MEDIA{...}%= parameters. 

To add other types add your own template using the same naming scheme (=objectplugin_ext.tmpl=).

---++ Examples

---+++ wmv
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
"http://support.microsoft.com/support/mediaplayer/wmptest/samples/new/mediaexample.wmv"
height="240"
width="320"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
"http://support.microsoft.com/support/mediaplayer/wmptest/samples/new/mediaexample.wmv"
height="240"
width="320"
}%

---+++ mov
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.mov"
height="180"
width="320"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.mov"
height="180"
width="320"
}%

By default the controller is shown (unless attribute =controller="false"=), and the controller height (16px) is automatically added to the movie height.

---+++ swf
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.swf"
height="180"
width="320"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.swf"
height="180"
width="320"
}%

---+++ swf with params
These are just a number of example parameters; not all are effective in this movie.
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
src="%ATTACHURL%/swf/ThumbController.swf"
width="430"
height="370"
bgcolor="#ffffff"
menu="false"
base="%ATTACHURL%/swf/"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
src="%ATTACHURL%/swf/ThumbController.swf"
width="430"
height="370"
bgcolor="#ffffff"
menu="false"
base="%ATTACHURL%/swf/"
}%

---+++ !YouTube
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
"http://www.youtube.com/v/-dnL00TdmLY&hl=en&fs=1"
width="425"
height="344"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
"http://www.youtube.com/v/-dnL00TdmLY&hl=en&fs=1"
width="425"
height="344"
}%

---+++ html
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.html"
arbitrary="plplpl"
}%
</verbatim>

generates:

%MEDIA{
"%ATTACHURL%/sample.html"
arbitrary="plplpl"
}%

---+++ png
<verbatim>
%MEDIA{
data="%ATTACHURL%/img/big/Faux-Fur.jpg"
type="image/png"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

%MEDIA{
data="%ATTACHURL%/img/big/Faux-Fur.jpg"
type="image/png"
}%

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference
a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, for example, ==%<nop>INTERWIKIPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Embed Multi-Media Objects into Foswiki topics

   * Default parameters for plugin. These *must* be defined. (For booleans use "TRUE" for true, anything else for false)
   * Set WIDTH = 320
   * Set HEIGHT = 180
   * Set CONTROLLER = TRUE
   * Set PLAY = TRUE

   * Set DEBUG = 0
